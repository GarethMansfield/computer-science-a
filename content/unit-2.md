# Objects

The last unit was concerned with primitive typesâ€”those that were already within Java. However, there might be other types of information that you are trying to represent in a variable. These are called *objects*. Using the same analogy, instead of Java knowing specifically that the variable box is containing an `int` variable or `double` variable, it is a special type that is usually defined by the user (or sometimes, already in Java).

## Classes

Here is how a class might be defined
<div class="example"></div>
```java
public class Cat {
		private int age;
		private double weight;

		public Cat() {
				// Constructor
		}

		...

}
```
We have now told the program that there is a new type of variable, a `Cat` object. Objects can contain *class variables*, these are variables that belong to this object. If each `Cat` is similarly a box, you can imagine smaller boxes (representing the class variables) being placed within the larger box of the cat.

If we want to create a new object of a certain class, we can call
```java
Cat kitty = new Cat();
```
which stores a pointer to the Cat object into the variable `kitty`.

Note:
 - When creating and storing objects, what is really stored is a pointer. This means that `Cat kittyTwo = kitty`, will still assign the same `Cat` object to `kittyTwo`. Changing something with `kitty` will also change that with `kittyTwo`.

## Methods

Classes can also have *methods* which are functions that can take some input and generate some output (this is optional).

For example, within the `Cat` class, there might be a `eat()` function:
```java
public void happyBirthday() {
		age += 1;
}
```
The parentheses after the `eat` is where parameters would go, if `eat` were to take any input variables. This example, however, does not. The `public` before the `eat()` indicate that code outside of the `Cat` class can access this method. The `void`, which is a *return type*, tells us that this function does not return an output.

Calling `kitty.happyBirthday()` will increase the age of `kitty`.

### Parameters and Returns

Consider another method:
```java
public double eat(double amount) {
		weight += amount;
		return weight;
}
```
Now, `eat` takes a variable `amount`, which is a `double`. Calling `kitty.eat(1.8)` will add 1.8 to `weight` of `kitty`. These are called *parameters* of a method, and they are added in the format `(type) (name)`. Multiple can be separated by a comma.

`eat` will do another thing, it will *return* the weight of the cat. This is done through the `return weight;` line of the code. Note that once something is returned, the method will stop running. We can use this return as we would any number: `double newWeight = kitty.eat(1.8) + 2`, for example.

### Getters and Setters

There are *accessor* and *mutator* methods (also called *getters* and *setters*) which retrieve and change class variables (since they are denoted `private`, no class outside can access these). For `Cat`, this is how they might look like.
<div class="example"></div>
```java
public int getAge() {
		return age;
}

public void setAge(int newAge) {
		age = newAge;
}
```

# Strings

`String`s are another common type of common objects in Java. They are built-in, and do not need to be written. As they are a class, the 'S' in String is capitalized (as opposed to `int` and `double`).

Here's an example String:
```java
String greeting = "Hello World!"
```

We can do many things with Strings, like compare them (alphabetically), get characters, get substrings (a String that is a part of the original string).

Here are all the string methods:
 - `int length()` which returns the length of the string, including spaces and all characters. `length(greeting)` returns 12.
 - `String substring(int from, int to)` returns a substring beginning at index `from` and ending at the character before index `to`. (see arrays [note to self to link] for an explanation of indices).
 - `String substring(int from)` returns the substring from `from` to the end.
 - `int indexOf(String str)` tries to find a substring `str` within the string. This returns the first occurrence of `str`, otherwise it returns `-1`.
 - `boolean equals(String other)` returns whether a string is equal another string.
	 - Do not use `==` on strings as they are objects, not primitive variables. Two strings with the exact same text might be different objects.
 - `int compareTo(String other)` compares the two strings. All you need to know is that it returns a value less than 0 if a string is less than `other` and more than 0 if a string is more than `other`.
	 - Technically, they are converted to unicode values and the values are compared.
	 - This provides an alphabetical ordering of strings.

# Math

There is a class that performs math functions. It is the `Math` class. This class only has what's called *static methods*, so instead of calling methods from an object of a class (recall we created a `Cat` named `kitty`), we can call them from the class itself.

Here are the methods in `Math`:
 - `Math.abs(int/double x)` returns the absolute value of `x` (this works for both integers and doubles).
 - `Math.pow(double base, double exponent)` returns `base` raised to the power of `exponent` as a double.
 - `Math.sqrt(double x)` returns the square root of `x` as a double.
 - `Math.random()` returns a double greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.
	 - We can generate integers in a certain range by taking doing `(int) Math.random() * n` which gives a nonnegative number less than `n`.
